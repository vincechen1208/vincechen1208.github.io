<h2 align="middle">Updated Plan</h2>
    <p>Instead of building PBD from scratch, we've decided to use the CUDA sample (particles) and build real time 3D liquid simulation. We've implemented a 
    constraint solver based on the algorithms described in [Macklin et al. 2013] to enforce incompressibility. To make the simulation more realistic, we've also resolved
    tensile instability and accounted for vorticity confinement and viscosity. Our next step would be to implement shaders to render different liquid surfaces. Although we 
    have changed our plans, we are on track to finish everything we originally planned to do, including the aspirations in our proposal. </p>
    

<h2 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h2>
    <p>By changing the spring constant, k_s, to a very low and very high value, I was able to observe how the stiffness of the spring affects the
    simulation of the cloth. As below, the picture to the left is simulated with a k_s value of 60000, and the picture to the right is simulated with
    a k_s value of 20. The stiffer the spring, or the bigger the value of k_s, the less folds we observe in the final simulation of the cloth.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/ks60000.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">k_s = 60000</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/ks20.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">k_s = 20</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>By changing the density, I was able to see how heavy the cloth was becoming and how that affected the simulation. The two pictures below are
    simulated with density values of 5 and 1500, and it is clear that the denser the cloth, the more it stretches and drapes from the two pinned
    points.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/density5.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">density = 5</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/density1500.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">density = 1500</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Lastly, by changing the damping value, I was able to observe that the lower the damping value, the bouncier the cloth is. Below are two
    screenshots of the cloth with damping at 1.0% and another at 0.02%. The one on the right is clearly stiffer and not as bouncy or soft as a cloth
    should be. The one on the left is too bouncy and soft for a regular cloth. I've also included a shaded version of pinned4.json below.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/damping002.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">damping = 0.02%</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/damping1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">damping = 1.0%</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pinned4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">pinned4.json shaded</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
