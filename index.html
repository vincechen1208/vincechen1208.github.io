<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
 ¬† ¬†<p>For our final project, we've chosen to implement 3D real-time fluid simulation by treating fluid as a huge set of particles that interact with each other and move at various velocities. We started off with the "particles" CUDA sample, where only particle collisions are handled. In order to simulate fluid-like motion within the particles, we implemented methods described in [Macklin et al. 2013] to enforce incompressibility. We also handled tensile instability, and enforced other constraints such as vorticity and viscosity. We implemented these methods in CUDA for real-time effects. Finally, we attempted surface rendering in order to render the surface reflection, refraction and shading of a liquid.</p>
    

<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>

	<h3>Full Pipeline</h3>
    <img src="image/alg.png" width="400px" align="middle" /> 
    <h3>Incompressibility</h3>
    <p>Instead of performing a physical calculation for the intermolecular attraction and repulsion, here, we adopted the constraint method to simulate a non-physical but realistic incompressibility effect. To formulate the constraint, we can leverage the fact that incompressibility implies constant local densities. First, we calculate the local densities for each particle in our scene, where particle <i><b>i</b></i> has a local density <i><b>œÅi</b></i> approximated by the following: <br>
        <img src="image/comp-1.png" width="200px" align="middle" />, where <i><b>œÅ0</b></i> is the rest density we define. <br>

    With this approximation, we can set up a state function: <br>
        <img src="image/comp-0.png" width="200px" align="middle" /> <br>
    In order to enforce constant density, we would want the state function to be <i><b>0</b></i>. <br>
    Therefore, given position <i><b>p</b></i> after a Euler update, one need to add a small modification <i><b>Œîp</b></i> so that: <br>
        <img src="image/comp-2.png" width="120px" align="middle" /> <br>
    By doing a taylor expansion and adding a relaxation term <b>ùúÄ</b>, we get the following solutions for <i><b>Œîp</b></i>: <br>
        <img src="image/comp-3.png" width="200px" align="middle" />, 
        <img src="image/comp-4.png" width="300px" align="middle" /> <br>
    The relaxation term <b>ùúÄ</b> acts as a crutial factor to regularize the contraint correction in order to stabilize the dynamics. <br>
    Also, for each frame, incompressibility contraint update and collision update will be applied for a couple of iterations in order to have a more stable motion.</p>


    <h3>Kernel functions</h3>
    <p>Recall that for approximating local density, we used a function <i><b>W</b></i>. This is the kernel function that give weights according to the distance. Intuitively, we would like to assign a higher density contribution to particles that are close, and the kernel function basically does this thing. <br>
    Empirically, we uses poly6 kernel to approximate the local densities, and spiky kernel to calculate the gradients. The two functions are as follows: <br>
        <img src="image/kernel_poly6.png" width="360px" align="middle" />,  
        <img src="image/kernel_spiky.png" width="360px" align="middle" /> <br></p>

	<h3>Tensile Instability</h3>
	<p>One of the biggest problems we ran into during this project was that some particles were affected by negative pressure and tended to clump and cluster together. We then realized that when a particle has too few neighbors and therefore does not satisfy the rest density, it will lead to the clustering and clumping of surrounding particles. This phenomenon is known as tensile instability. In order to solve tensile instability, we implemented the method by Monaghan described in [Macklin et al. 2013]. Following the steps, we added in a correction term when updating the positions of each particle to act as an "artificial pressure" in order to push the clustered particles apart. The correction term is iteself specified in terms of the smoothing kernel we used above for incompressibility and is shown below. The updated position-update equation is also shown below.</p>

	<img src="image/tensile-1.png" width="300px" align="middle" /> <br>
	<img src="image/tensile-2.png" width="360px" align="middle" />

	<p>In the above equation, ‚àÜq is a random fixed distance within the smoothing kernel radius and k is a small constant. We've fine-tuned these parameters to produce the best visual effects. Since the correction term is purely negative, the above correction term is a purely repulsive force. As a result, each particle now pulls their neighboring particles inward, creating a surface-tension like effect, which further makes the simulation behave more like an actual fluid.</p>

	<h3>Vorticity Confinement</h3>
    <p>The constraints applied so far are not physically correct, and unfortunately in this case our implementation will dissipate considerable energy. This generates a undesirable effect where the fluids are not moving enough. In order to add the energy back, we reinforce the local vorticity of the fluid. First, we calculate the current approximate of the local vorticity given as follows: <br>
        <img src="image/vort-0.png" width="300px" align="middle" />, which is the curl of the velocity vector field weighted by the kernel function. <br>
    Afterwards, we apply the additional vorticity force to the particle to enhance the local spinning motion. The force is calculated by: <br>
        <img src="image/vort-1.png" width="150px" align="middle" />, <br> where <i><b>N</b></i> is the normalized position of the particle with respect to local center of mass, and <b>ùúÄ</b> determines how much vorticity we are adding back to the fluid.</p>

    <h3>Viscosity</h3>
    <p>In order to make the particles look even more like a fluid, or more "viscouse", we apply some damping to "stick" the particles together. We update the velocity equation to include this damping term, which is important for coherent motion among the particles. We fine-tune the constant c to produce the best visual results. The updated velocity equation is shown below.</p>

    <img src="image/visc-1.png" width="360px" align="middle" />

<h3>Rendering</h3>
<p>The starter code "particles" from CUDA samples implements the basic rendering of each particle as a diffuse surface of some defined color with a fix light source. Depth test was handled by the opengl library. Particle appearance was by default a gradient of rainbow colors. Mouse drag events rotate the scene around, which is rendered using a lookat matrix transform followed by a projection transform to 2D screen. </p>

<p>Surface reconstruction of particle based dynamical systems are difficult because there are no naturally existing surfaces or meshes to use for rendering. We attempted to implement the approach described in the talk given by Simon Green (NVIDIA) at the Game Developers Conference in 2010, titled "Screen Space Fluid Rendering for Games". The advantage of this method is that only the surface closest to the camera is rendered by construction of the depth image, which significantly reduces computation cost and works well for real time applications. The high level overview of the algorithm is as follows: </p>

<pre>
  <code>
    1. Generate and render depth image of particles as point sprites.
    2. Smooth depth image (with Gaussian blur or bilateral filter).
    3. Calculate surface normals and positions from depth.
    4. Shade surface (Bling Phong or Fresnel equation plus reflection).
    5. Account for thickness (volumetric absorption, described by Beer's law).
  </code>
</pre>

<p> The depth image can easily be rendered using by calculating the depth of each particle in the pixel shader. Shown below is the dam break scene rendered with the depth image (100k particles, real time screen capture): </p>

    	<table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <video align="middle" width="480" height="400" controls loop>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

<p> Unfortuantely, attempts to render the blurred depth image fell short and we were unable to continue on the later steps of shading the surface and accounting for thickness to render a realistic fluid surface. The main difficulty of debugging the vertex and pixel shaders was that it was difficult to determine whether the root cause of a bug was within the shaders or with how the blurred output was displayed on screen. </p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>One of our major challenges in this project was debugging the CUDA code. Cuda device functions (functions with __device__ header) 
were executed only in the gpu, and we were not able to print out variables in device functions. This causes some trouble to debug. 
Thankfully, it is possible to actually use a pointer to store the variable and print it out in the host functions. After knowing that, 
our debug process went much smoother.</p>
<p>The other major challenge was rendering the surface of the fluid. This was particularly difficult because our trick of using a pointer
to print out values in CUDA functions does not apply to OpenGL shaders, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the error. We
were able to solve some bugs by encoding certain values in the fragment color as clues. However, when the display code itself was also in 
question, we were unfortunately unable to finish debugging.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The most important lesson we learned was probably the power of parallel processing on GPU. Simulating 3D point based fluids is definitely
a hard task computational-wise. However, we're able to parallelize the dynamics calculation for each particle and achieve real-time simulation.
This is super cool! After this project, we will definitely cherish a GPU much more when playing games.</p>
